	faqsTitle: "Frequently Asked Questions About Open Source Screen Recording",
	faqs: [
		{
			question: "Is Orbit really open source?",
			answer:
				"Yes. Orbit is fully open source and MIT-licensed. The complete codebase — desktop app, web app, Rust media processing pipeline, and all backend services — is publicly available on GitHub. You can inspect every line, fork the project, and contribute back to the community.",
		},
		{
			question: "Can I self-host Orbit's screen recordings?",
			answer:
				"Yes. Orbit supports any S3-compatible storage provider, including AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, Backblaze B2, and self-hosted MinIO. Configure your own bucket in Orbit's settings and your recordings are stored entirely within your infrastructure — Orbit's servers never see your content.",
		},
		{
			question: "What is the best open source screen recorder?",
			answer:
				"Orbit is the best open source screen recorder for most users because it combines full transparency with practical features: 4K recording, instant shareable links, webcam overlay, AI captions, and built-in thread commenting. OBS Studio is also open source but designed for streaming rather than async screen sharing and instant link generation.",
		},
		{
			question: "Is Orbit's open source version free?",
			answer:
				"Yes. Orbit's Studio Mode is completely free for personal use with no time limits and no watermarks. Instant Mode on the free plan supports recordings up to 5 minutes. Orbit Pro ($9.99/month) removes Instant Mode time limits and adds team features. The core software will always be open source and free to use.",
		},
		{
			question:
				"How does Orbit compare to OBS Studio as an open source recorder?",
			answer:
				"Both Orbit and OBS Studio are open source, but they serve different workflows. OBS requires significant setup and is built for live streaming. Orbit is designed for async screen sharing — you record, get a shareable link in seconds, and viewers can leave timestamped comments. Orbit is the better open source screen recorder for teams and everyday recording.",
		},
		{
			question: "Can I contribute to Orbit's development?",
			answer:
				"Absolutely. Orbit welcomes contributions of all kinds — bug reports, feature requests, code contributions, and documentation improvements. Visit Orbit's GitHub repository to file issues, browse open tasks, or submit a pull request. The roadmap is public and shaped by community feedback.",
		},
		{
			question: "Does Orbit work on Mac and Windows?",
			answer:
				"Yes. Orbit is available as a native desktop app for macOS and Windows. Both versions are included in the same open-source repository. <a href='/screen-recorder-mac'>Learn more about screen recording on Mac</a> or <a href='/screen-recorder-windows'>learn more about screen recording on Windows</a>.",
		},
		{
			question: "What license does Orbit use?",
			answer:
				"Orbit is released under the MIT License, one of the most permissive open-source licenses available. You are free to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and sell copies of the software. Commercial use is permitted. Attribution is required.",
