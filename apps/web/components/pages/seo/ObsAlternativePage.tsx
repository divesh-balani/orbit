	description:
		"Orbit is the modern OBS alternative built for async screen sharing, not live streaming. Record in 4K, get a shareable link in seconds, and collaborate with timestamped comments. No configuration required.",

	badge: "OBS Alternative",

	featuresTitle: "Why Teams Choose Orbit Over OBS Studio",
	featuresDescription:
		"OBS is powerful for live streaming — but for everyday async recording and sharing, Orbit is faster, simpler, and built for teams",

	features: [
		{
			title: "Zero Configuration",
			description:
				"OBS requires scene setup, audio routing, encoder tuning, and plugin management before you can record. Orbit works out of the box — install it, click record, and your link is ready in seconds. No scenes, no profiles, no bitrate math.",
		},
		{
			title: "Instant Shareable Links",
			description:
				"Stop recording and Orbit immediately generates a shareable link. Paste it into Slack, email, or a GitHub issue and your team can watch without downloading anything. OBS outputs local files that require manual upload to every platform you use.",
		},
		{
			title: "Built-In Async Collaboration",
			description:
				"Orbit viewers can leave timestamped comments directly on your recording — no third-party platform needed. OBS has no built-in sharing or commenting. Teams using OBS end up uploading to YouTube, Loom, or Dropbox just to share a clip.",
		},
		{
			title: "Webcam Overlay Without Plugins",
			description:
				"Orbit includes a polished picture-in-picture webcam overlay as a first-class feature. OBS supports webcam through source layers but requires manual positioning, cropping, and scene management every time you change setups.",
		},
		{
			title: "AI Captions Included",
			description:
				"Orbit automatically generates accurate captions from your recordings using AI transcription. OBS has no transcription capability — you need separate software, manual uploads to YouTube, or a third-party service to add captions to OBS recordings.",
		},
		{
			title: "4K Recording at 60fps",
			description:
				"Orbit captures your screen at up to 4K resolution and 60 frames per second with system audio and microphone. You get the same recording quality as OBS with a fraction of the setup time and none of the encoder configuration.",
		},
		{
			title: "Cloud Storage and Self-Hosting",
			description:
				"Orbit uploads recordings automatically and generates links. For teams with data requirements, Orbit supports any S3-compatible storage — AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, or your own MinIO instance. OBS saves locally by default with no cloud integration.",
		},
		{
			title: "Open Source Like OBS",
			description:
				"Orbit is MIT-licensed and fully open source on GitHub, just like OBS. You can audit the code, contribute features, and self-host the entire platform. You get OBS's commitment to transparency with the usability of a modern sharing tool.",
		},

		title: "Two Recording Modes for Every Workflow",

				title: "Instant Mode",
				description:

			},
			{
				icon: (
					<Clapperboard
						fill="var(--blue-9)"
						className="mb-4 size-8"
						strokeWidth={1.5}

				title: "Studio Mode",
				description:
					"Completely free for personal use with no time limits. Records screen and webcam as separate tracks for post-production flexibility. Ideal for tutorials, product demos, and training content where you want full control — without the complexity of OBS scene management.",

	faqsTitle: "Frequently Asked Questions About OBS Alternatives",
	faqs: [
		{
			question: "Why would I use Orbit instead of OBS Studio?",
			answer:
				"OBS Studio is the best tool for live streaming, but it's complex and saves files locally. Orbit is designed for async screen sharing — you get a shareable link the moment you stop recording, with built-in commenting and AI captions. If you're recording to share with teammates or customers rather than to stream live, Orbit is faster and simpler.",
		},
		{
			question: "Is Orbit free like OBS?",
			answer:
				"Yes. Orbit's Studio Mode is completely free for personal use with no time limits and no watermarks. Instant Mode on the free plan supports recordings up to 5 minutes. Orbit Pro ($9.99/month) removes Instant Mode time limits and adds team features. The core software is open source and free to use, just like OBS.",
		},
		{
			question: "Is Orbit open source like OBS?",
			answer:
				"Yes. Orbit is fully open source and MIT-licensed on GitHub. You can inspect the complete codebase, contribute features, and self-host the entire platform. Both Orbit and OBS are open source — but Orbit uses the permissive MIT License while OBS uses the GPL.",
		},
		{
			question: "Can Orbit do live streaming like OBS?",
			answer:
				"No. Orbit is built for async screen recording and sharing, not live streaming. If you need to broadcast live to Twitch, YouTube, or other platforms, OBS Studio remains the best tool. Orbit and OBS are complementary — use OBS for live streaming and Orbit for async recording and team sharing.",
		},
		{
			question: "Does Orbit support the same recording quality as OBS?",
			answer:
				"Yes. Orbit records at up to 4K resolution and 60 frames per second with system audio and microphone. You get the same video quality as OBS without the encoder configuration. Orbit handles bitrate, format, and compression automatically so you don't have to tune settings before every recording.",
		},
		{
			question:
				"What happens to my recordings after I stop recording in Orbit?",
			answer:
				"Orbit automatically uploads your recording and generates a shareable link in seconds. You can paste this link anywhere — Slack, email, GitHub, Notion — and viewers can watch without downloading any files. You can also configure Orbit to store recordings in your own S3-compatible bucket for complete data control.",
		},
		{
			question: "Does Orbit work on Mac and Windows like OBS?",
			answer:
				"Yes. Orbit is available as a native desktop app for macOS and Windows, just like OBS. Both platforms are supported in the same open-source repository. <a href='/screen-recorder-mac'>Learn more about screen recording on Mac</a> or <a href='/screen-recorder-windows'>learn more about screen recording on Windows</a>.",
		},
		{
			question: "Can I self-host Orbit like I can self-host OBS outputs?",
			answer:
				"Yes. Orbit supports any S3-compatible storage provider, including AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, Backblaze B2, and self-hosted MinIO. Configure your own bucket in Orbit's settings and your recordings are stored entirely within your infrastructure. For teams that need complete data sovereignty, Orbit provides the same control as managing OBS output files locally.",
